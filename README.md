# Basic_Pothole_Detection_System
Arduino Nano-based prototype to enhance vehicle safety by detecting potholes and road bumps in real time. The system measures Z-axis acceleration using the MPU6050 accelerometer to identify sudden vertical changes on the road, and uses ultrasonic distance sensing to detect bumps.

#Hardware: Arduino Nano, MPU6050, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, 16Ã—2 I2C LCD, Buzzer
#Software: Arduino IDE, C++ (Embedded programming)
