### Basic_Pothole_Detection_System
Arduino Nano-based prototype to enhance vehicle safety by detecting potholes and road bumps in real time. The system measures Z-axis acceleration using the MPU6050 accelerometer to identify sudden vertical changes on the road, and uses ultrasonic distance sensing to detect bumps.
